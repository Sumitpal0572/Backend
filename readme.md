## Backend

-  The backend refers to the server-side of a web application, where the core functionality of the application is implemented.
- It is responsible for processing client requests, managing databases, performing business logic, and ensuring that the appropriate data and services are delivered to the frontend.

### Client-Server Model

- The client-server model is a foundational concept in network architecture, where the communication between two parties is established through a client and a server.

- In this model, the client is typically a web browser or application that initiates requests for specific resources or services.

- The server, on the other hand, is a powerful computer or set of computers that processes these requests and sends back the appropriate responses, such as data, webpages, or files.
